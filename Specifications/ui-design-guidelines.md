## UI Design Guidelines
- Implement proper form validation with clear visual feedback. 
- All form fields should show validation state (valid/invalid) and disable submit buttons until all required fields are properly filled. 
- Create thorough bUnit tests that verify form controls properly update component state and enable/disable related UI elements.
