# Family Shopping Application Specification

## Purpose

The Family Shopping Application exists to simplify multi-store shopping by providing a centralized system for managing product inventories and shopping needs across multiple retail locations. The application eliminates the inefficiency of visiting stores that don't carry needed items and optimizes shopping trips by showing product availability across all tracked stores.

## Core User Workflow

The application supports a three-phase shopping workflow:
1. **Planning Phase**: Users add needed products to their shopping list via the Dashboard
2. **Analysis Phase**: The system displays which stores carry the needed items and calculates coverage percentages
3. **Execution Phase**: Users visit the most efficient stores and mark items as purchased upon completion

This workflow transforms shopping from a reactive, inefficient process into a data-driven, optimized experience that minimizes time spent visiting stores that don't carry needed items.
