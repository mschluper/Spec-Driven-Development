# Application Page: Recipes

**Purpose**: Maintain a collection of recipes and their ingredients. 

The Recipes Page displays all defined recipes in a table, each with their ingredients in a separate column.  Editing a Recipe enables the user to define the recipe name and what products are needed for the recipe (as ingredients). 

## Tests
1. **Recipe Creation**: Users can add new recipes by specifying the recipe name, how many people it serves, and selecting which products it requires.

2. **Products Required**: During recipe creation and editing, users can select multiple products that are ingredients. Upon updating the recipe, all its ingredients are persisted.

3. **Filter by Product**: Users can select a product and see what recipes use the selected product as ingredient.
